# Customer Complaints Email Classification Case Study

> ## Instructions
>
> You are asked to put a model in production for the customer service center to classify emails in one of the provided product categories. For the purpose of this exercise,
> 1. please create a basic ML model using the dataset provided and use it to complete the tasks below.
> 1. Prepare your solution for deployment: implement an ML inference pipeline and deploy a REST endpoint that consumes the trained ML model using the technology of your choice.
> 1. Think of ways to monitor the model performance.
> It is sufficient to present your solution "demo style", i.e. showcasing live functionality while sharing your screen.
> 1. You should not spend more than 8 hours on this project. We encourage you to keep the solution simple. The purpose of the case study is to showcase code quality and deployment. Anything missing from your solution due to time you can tell us about in the demo.
> 1. (Optional) If you want a challenge and want to go a step further, consider model management/versioning capabilities.
>
>
> ### Notes on Instructions
>
> 1. Python is our main language of work and must be assignment.
> 1. Coding style and code modularization are important aspects that will be evaluated for this task.
> 1. Please focus on the ML lifecycle of a project (training, prediction/inference, and validation). Data science processes such as EDA, feature engineering or model optimization are this case study.
>
> 1. You do not have to make any slides. It is sufficient to present your solution "demo style", i.e. showcasing live functionality while sharing your screen.
> 1. There are (open source) platforms for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. Feel free to use one that you feel most comfortable with.
> 1. Please prepare all materials in English.

## Business Problem

> A customer service center at a large bank receives more and more complaints via email every day. Forwarding of emails to the respective experts in the topic of complaint is delayed due to the ever increasing amount of emails. This leads to delays in processing the complaints which in return leads to even more complaint emails.
>
> More and more customers are unhappy and changing to other banks, resulting in a huge loss in business. The bank has a great business interest to improve and speed up their customer service. Therefore, emails should automatically be forwarded to the right department, in order to erase one of the current bottlenecks.
